# House Price Prediction - Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline to preprocess data for a house price prediction model using the Kaggle [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) dataset.

It focuses on:
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling
- One-hot encoding
- Combining preprocessing steps with Pipeline and ColumnTransformer

# Dataset

Make sure the following files are present in your working directory:
- `train.csv` – contains training features and the target column `SalePrice`
- `test.csv` – contains test features only
